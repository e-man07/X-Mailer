X-Mailer
xmailer.xyz – Email powered by Solana Blinks.
Let anyone message you directly from Twitter without leaving the platform.

<!-- Update this path if needed -->

Overview
X-Mailer is a Web3-native communication tool that lets creators, businesses, and professionals receive emails directly through Solana Blinks. Users generate a unique Blink, post it on X (Twitter), and others can click it to instantly send an email without ever leaving the platform.

It bridges the gap between traditional communication and the decentralized web.

Features

Connect your wallet – Web3-native identity with Solana.

Blink generation dashboard – Instantly create and manage your Blinks.

Anti-spam – Each email sent through a Blink involves a small on-chain interaction, filtering out bots.

Fully mobile optimized – Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile.

Green-hacker cyberpunk UI – Built for the bold.

How It Works

Enter your email address (where you want messages delivered).
